# Javascript-Exercises

Some of JS exercises to help explore more and these were some of the problems that I practised to learn.

These are a series of JavaScript exercises intended to be used alongside the curriculum at 'The Odin Project'.

## How To Use These Exercises
Before you start you should have a few things installed on your machine:

NPM. To check if you have NPM installed, type npm --version in your terminal. If you get back Command 'npm' not found, but can be installed with:, do NOT follow the instructions in the terminal to install with apt-get. (This causes permission issues.) Instead, install Node with NVM by following the instructions here.
A copy of this repository. Copies of repositories on your machine are called clones. If you need help cloning, you can learn how here.
Jest. After cloning this repository to your local machine, go into the newly created directory (cd javascript-exercises) and run npm install. This will install Jest and set up the testing platform based on our preconfigured settings.
